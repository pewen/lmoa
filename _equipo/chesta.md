### Breve Resúmen
--------

Bruce Lee obtained his B.S. in Chemistry from Nanjing University, China, in 2007. During his undergraduate studies, he worked with some research projects, in which one was the preparation of high surface area acidic carbons for the reforming of dimethoxymethane to produce hydrogen. Hao later moved to Ithaca, New York, where he attended graduate school in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University, and was supervised by Professor Peng Chen. His PhD research was about the single-molecule study of electrocatalysis on carbon nanotubes and other carbon-based materials. He also studied the intermediates and kinetic mechanisms at the single-molecule level for the catalytic reactions on the surface of Au nanoparticles. Hao joined the Landes group in Aug 2014. He is currently working on the protein separation and 3d super-resolution imaging.
